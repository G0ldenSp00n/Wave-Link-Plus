## Wave-Link-Plus
- More control over WaveLink channels using Stream Deck and a Wave Mic.  This plugin allows the use of the headphone output dial on the Wave Link to control the channels in WaveLink.  In order to not affect the output volume a different output other than the Wave headphone jack must be used. (ie. Bluetooth, headphone jack on computer).

### Features
- Control WaveLink Channels using Wave Mic knob
- Switch between WaveLink Channels using the Stream Deck

### Known Issues
- Stream Deck icons don't always stay highlighted to indicate the active channel
- Only the headphone output can be control, selecting "Stream Mix" in Stream Deck software will still control the "Monitor Mix"
